<h1>Travel</h1>
<p>
 I always like experiencing new things because they make life more exciting and meaningful. Trying different activities allows me to learn more about myself and discover what I truly enjoy. I believe there are still many activities I havenâ€™t done yet or have missed the chance to try in the past. Now I want to make a list of a few experiences I would really like to do soon. First, I want to try horse riding, which seems adventurous and unique. Second, I would like to start going to the gym to stay healthy. Finally, I want to experience camping.
  I think there are some activities that <strong>i <em class="em-red">havent done</em> or I <em class="em-red">missed</em> them.</strong> now I want to list them:

  <li>Horse riding</li>
  <li>Go to gym</li>
  <li>Camping</li>
